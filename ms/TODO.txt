BOTH:
- Are there any other published method to compare with except kmergenie?
- Write introduction

Kristoffer:
- Results:
	- Methods:
		- optimal_k
		- KmerGenie
	- Data sets:
		- staph
		- rhodo
		- human (chr14)
		- plasmid

	- Assemblers:
		- Unitiger
		- Velvet
		- Minia

	- Evaluation
		- Similarity to unitiger (our tool only)
		- Runtime
		- Memory
		- NG50, E-size, Size, Errors

Alex:
- Make optimal-k support several read files - i.e. fix bug.
- Make unitiger have an option not to print to file
- Implement sample size estimate for number of nodes, number of unitigs
- Implement E-size estimate in cpp (for single abundance suffices)
