BOTH:
- Are there any other published method to compare with except kmergenie?
- Write introduction

Kristoffer:
- Implement paralellizaton of jobs on uppmax with snakemake
- Implement (separate) analysis of optimal-k vs unitiger (separate snakefile)
- Implement Velvet/ABySS into pipeline

- Results:
	- Methods:
		- optimal_k
		- KmerGenie
		- velvet optimizor and velvet_advisor?
	- Data sets:
		- staph
		- rhodo
		- human (chr14)
		- plasmid
		- spruce

	- Assemblers:
		- Unitiger
		- Velvet
		- Minia

	- Evaluation
		- Similarity to unitiger (our tool only)
		- Runtime
		- Memory
		- NG50, E-size, Size, Errors

Alex:
16 March ->
- [DONE] ask Jouni about dependence between buffer size and RAM usage and add max RAM as input parameter (just add another parameter "medium memory", "low memory")
- [DONE: Now we thin the reads at 0.5] maybe not keep the reads into RAM when sampling. TODO: keep as many as the peak memory during construction allows
- [?] fix Unitiger on large datasets
- nb unitigs is estimated only if --estnumunitigs is on
- add columns "margin of error for n_nodes", "margin of error for n_unitigs", "margin of error for e_size": value
- remove ess column

AGENDA:
- Automatically choose highest kmer size OR stop at some value of k


PAPER:
- remove avg unitig length section
- remove sample size for inverse of proportion
- add statement of avg unitig length in E-size accuracy
- add statement about sampling abundance bias in E-size accuracy
- check Alg 3 and 4
