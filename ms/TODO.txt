BOTH:
- Are there any other published method to compare with except kmergenie?
- Write introduction

Kristoffer:
- Results:
	- Methods:
		- optimal_k
		- KmerGenie
	- Data sets:
		- staph
		- rhodo
		- human (chr14)
		- plasmid

	- Assemblers:
		- Unitiger
		- Velvet
		- Minia

	- Evaluation
		- Similarity to unitiger (our tool only)
		- Runtime
		- Memory
		- NG50, E-size, Size, Errors

Alex:
- [FIXED: the only way was to write a wrapper: GATB has a problem with multiple values of k] Make optimal-k support several read files - i.e. fix bug.
- [DONE: added the option -s] Make unitiger have an option not to print to file
- [DONE: added the option -t] make unitiger run single thread (the graph construction)
- [DONE] make all reads uppercase 
- [DONE: but we need to cover corner cases, like p~0 or p~1] Implement sample size estimate for number of nodes, number of unitigs
- Implement E-size estimate in cpp (for single abundance suffices)
- Write installation instructions in README.txt
- [DONE]Automatically choose highest kmer size (readlength - 10). For practical and time efficiency reasons. ALSO now mink = 15
